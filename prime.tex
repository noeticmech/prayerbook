\subsection{Psalm 5}

Hear my words, O Lord; consider my cry. Attend unto the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God, for unto Thee will I pray, O Lord. Early in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; early in the morning will I stand before Thee, and Thou shalt watch over me. For Thou art a God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; the evil-doer shall not dwell nigh Thee. Such as be lawless shall not stand in Thy sight, for Thou hatest all them that work iniquity. Thou shalt destroy all them that speak lies; the Lord will abhor the blood-thirsty and deceitful man. But as for me, by the multitude of Thy mercy I will come into Thine house; in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy temple. Lead me, O Lord, in Thy righteousness; because of mine enemies, make my way plain before Thee. For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue. Judge them, O God; let them fall through their own imaginations; cast them out according to the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have embittered Thee, O Lord. And let all them that put their trust in Thee be glad; they shall ever rejoice; and Thou shalt dwell in them and they that love Thy Name shall be joyful in Thee. For Thou wilt bless the righteous, O Lord, for with the shield of Thy favorable kindness hast Thou crowned us.

\subsection{Psalm 89}

Lord, Thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation. Before ever the mountains were formed, or the earth and the world were created, even from age to age Thou art. Turn not man away unto humiliation; yea, Thou hast said, Be converted, ye children of men. For a thousand years before Thine eyes, O Lord, are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. Fleeting shall their years be; he shall go by in the morning like the grass; in the morning it shall flourish, and grow up, but in the evening it shall fall away, and dry up, and wither. For we consumed away in Thy displeasure, and were troubled at Thy wrathful indignation. Thou hast set our misdeeds before Thee, our years are in the light of Thy countenance. For all our days are spent, and we have disappeared in Thy wrath; Our years are spun out like a spiderâ€™s web. The days of our age are threescore years and ten, or if we be so strong, fourscore years, and more than these is but labor and sorrow; for frailty shall come upon us, and we shall be chastened. Who knoweth the power of Thy wrath, and from fear of Thee, who can recount Thine anger? So make Thy right hand known to me, and to them that are bound by the heart in wisdom. Turn Thee again, O Lord; how long? And be gracious unto Thy servants. We were satisfied with Thy mercy in the morning, O Lord, and we rejoiced and were glad; We were glad all our days; for the days wherein Thou didst humble us, the years wherein we saw adversity. And look upon Thy servants, and upon Thy works, and guide their children, and let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and prosper Thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, prosper Thou our handy-work.

\subsection{Psalm 100}

Mercy and judgment shall be my song unto Thee, O Lord; I sing and understand in a blameless way; when wilt Thou come unto me? I have walked in the innocency of my heart in the midst of my house. I have set no unlawful thing before mine eyes; I have hated the workers of iniquity. A froward heart hath not cleaved unto me; I did not know the crafty man that turned away from me. Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him did I drive out; whoso hath a proud look and a greedy stomach, with such I did not eat. Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; whoso leadeth a godly life, he shall be my servant. The proud doer hath not dwelt in the midst of my house; he that speaketh unjustly shall have no place in my sight. In the morning I slew all the sinners of the land, to consume all the workers of lawlessness from the city of the Lord.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: both now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
