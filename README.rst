Prayerbook Readme
=================

Here is a quick rundown of what is what in this project:

prayerbook.tex
  File containing all the document-level settings and commands (such as `rubric`),
  as well as pre-matter content and includes for all the main matter.

sections/
  Contains LaTeX files for each section of the prayer book.

prayers/
  Contains LaTex files for common prayers found in multiple services/sections.

psalms/
  Contains LaTeX files for psalms for use in multiple services/sections.

Prayers and psalms have been split out from the services so that changes to the
text of these prayers will be uniformly applied throughout the prayer book. These
LaTeX files (ideally) contain a comment indicating the source.
