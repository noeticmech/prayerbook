% source: A Psalter for Prayer
I believed, so I spake; but I was greatly humbled. I said in my confusion, All men are liars. What shall I render unto the Lord, for all that He hath rendered unto me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the presence of all His people. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints. O Lord, I am Thy servant; I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine handmaid; Thou hast broken my bonds in sunder. I will offer unto Thee a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the Name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Lordâ€™s house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
