% source: A Psalter for Prayer
Thou hast been gracious, O Lord, unto Thy land, Thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob. Thou hast forgiven the offenses of Thy people; Thou hast covered all their sins. Thou hast curtailed all Thy displeasure; Thou hast relented from the wrath of Thine indignation. Convert us, then, O God of our salvation, and let Thine anger cease from us. Wilt Thou be displeased at us for ever? Or wilt Thou stretch out Thy wrath from one generation to another? O God, Thou shalt stay Thyself; Thou shalt revive us, and Thy people shall rejoice in Thee. Show us, O Lord, Thy mercy, and grant us Thy salvation. I will hear what the Lord God will say concerning me; for He shall speak peace unto His people, and to His saints, and to them that turn their hearts unto Him. Surely His salvation is nigh them that fear Him, that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met together, justice and peace have kissed each other. Truth hath flourished out of the earth, and justice hath looked down from heaven. For the Lord shall show loving-kindness, and our land shall give her increase. Justice shall go before Him, and shall set His steps in the way.
