% source: A Psalter for Prayer
Mercy and judgment shall be my song unto Thee, O Lord; I sing and understand in a blameless way; when wilt Thou come unto me? I have walked in the innocency of my heart in the midst of my house. I have set no unlawful thing before mine eyes; I have hated the workers of iniquity. A froward heart hath not cleaved unto me; I did not know the crafty man that turned away from me. Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him did I drive out; whoso hath a proud look and a greedy stomach, with such I did not eat. Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; whoso leadeth a godly life, he shall be my servant. The proud doer hath not dwelt in the midst of my house; he that speaketh unjustly shall have no place in my sight. In the morning I slew all the sinners of the land, to consume all the workers of lawlessness from the city of the Lord.
