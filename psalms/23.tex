% source: A Psalter for Prayer
The earth is the Lordâ€™s, and the fullness thereof; the compass of the world, and all that dwell therein. He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in His holy place? Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart, who doth not take his soul in vain, nor swear falsely to his neighbor. He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Savior. This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, even of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob. Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? It is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? Even the Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.
