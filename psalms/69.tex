% source: A Psalter for Prayer
O God, make speed to save me; O Lord, make haste to help me. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that wish me evil. Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame that say over me, Well, well. Let all those that seek Thee be joyful and glad in Thee, O God, and let all such as delight in Thy salvation say always, The Lord be praised. But I am poor and needy, O God; help me! Thou art my helper and my redeemer, O Lord; make no long tarrying.
