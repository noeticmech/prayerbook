% source: A Psalter for Prayer
How amiable are Thy dwellings, O Lord of hosts! My soul desireth and longeth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God. Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the dove a nest where she may lay her young, even Thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house, for ever and ever will they praise Thee. Blessed is the man whose help is from Thee, in his heart he hath proposed ascents into the valley of tears, unto the place which he hath appointed, for the law-giver shall give the blessing. They will go from strength to strength; the God of gods shall appear in Zion. O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; hearken, O God of Jacob. Behold, O God, our defender, and look upon the face of Thy Christ. For one day in Thy courts is better than a thousand; I have preferred to be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of sinners. For the Lord loveth mercy and truth, God will give grace and glory; the Lord shall withhold no good thing from them that walk innocently. O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man that putteth his trust in Thee.
