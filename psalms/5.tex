% source: A Psalter for Prayer
Hear my words, O Lord; consider my cry. Attend unto the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God, for unto Thee will I pray, O Lord. Early in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; early in the morning will I stand before Thee, and Thou shalt watch over me. For Thou art a God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; the evil-doer shall not dwell nigh Thee. Such as be lawless shall not stand in Thy sight, for Thou hatest all them that work iniquity. Thou shalt destroy all them that speak lies; the Lord will abhor the blood-thirsty and deceitful man. But as for me, by the multitude of Thy mercy I will come into Thine house; in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy temple. Lead me, O Lord, in Thy righteousness; because of mine enemies, make my way plain before Thee. For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue. Judge them, O God; let them fall through their own imaginations; cast them out according to the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have embittered Thee, O Lord. And let all them that put their trust in Thee be glad; they shall ever rejoice; and Thou shalt dwell in them and they that love Thy Name shall be joyful in Thee. For Thou wilt bless the righteous, O Lord, for with the shield of Thy favorable kindness hast Thou crowned us.
