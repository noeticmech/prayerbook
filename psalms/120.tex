% source: A Psalter for Prayer
I lifted up mine eyes unto the hills; from whence will my help come? My help cometh even from the Lord, Who hath made heaven and earth. Suffer not thy feet to slip, nor Him that keepeth thee to slumber. Behold, He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord Himself shall keep thee; the Lord is thy shelter upon thy right hand; The sun shall not burn thee by day, neither the moon by night. The Lord shall keep thee from all evil; yea, the Lord shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, from this time forth, and for evermore.
