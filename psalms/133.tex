% source: A Psalter for Prayer
Behold now, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, that stand in the house of the Lord, even in the courts of the house of our God. Lift up your hands by night in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord. The Lord bless thee out of Zion, Who hath made heaven and earth.
