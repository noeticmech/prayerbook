% source: A Psalter for Prayer
The Lord is my shepherd; therefore can I lack nothing. He maketh me to lie down in a green pasture; He leadeth me beside the still water. He hath converted my soul; He hath set me on the paths of righteousness, for His Nameâ€™s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they have comforted me. Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that trouble me; Thou hast anointed my head with oil, and Thy cup that inebriateth me, how strong it is! And Thy mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
