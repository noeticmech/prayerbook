O Lord and Master of my life, take from me the spirit of sloth, meddling, lust of power and idle talk. \rubric{(prostration)}

But give rather the spirit of chastity, humility, patience, and love to thy servant. \rubric{(prostration)}

Yea, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own sins and not to judge my brother, for thou art blessed unto ages of ages. Amen. \rubric{(prostration)}
