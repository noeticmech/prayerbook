\section{Troparia and Kontakia for Weekdays} \label{weekday}

\subsection{Monday}

\subsubsection{Apolytikion}

\rubric{(Tone 4)} Supreme Commanders of the Hosts of the Heavens, we, the unworthy, importune and beseech you that by your supplications ye encircle us in the shelter of the wings of your immaterial glory, guarding us who now fall down and cry to you with fervor: Deliver us from dangers of all kinds, as the great marshals of the heavenly hosts on high.

\subsubsection{Kontakion}

\rubric{(Tone 2)} Supreme Commanders of God and ministers of the Divine Glory, guides of men and leaders of the bodiless hosts: Ask for what is to our profit and for great mercy, since ye are Supreme Commanders of the bodiless hosts.

\subsection{Tuesday}

\subsubsection{Apolytikion}

\rubric{(Tone 2)} The memory of the just is celebrated with hymns of praise, but the Lord's testimony is sufficient for thee, O Forerunner; for thou hast proved to be truly even more venerable than the Prophets since thou was granted to baptize in the running waters Him Whom they proclaimed. Wherefore, having contested for the truth, thou didst rejoice to announce the good tidings even to those in Hades: that God hath appeared in the flesh, taking away the sin of the world and granting us great mercy. 

\subsubsection{Kontakion}

\rubric{(Tone 2)} O Prophet of God and Forerunner of Grace, having obtained thy head from the earth as a most sacred rose, we are always receiving healings; for still as of old in the world thou preachest repentance. 

\subsection{Wednesday}

\subsubsection{Apolytikion}

\rubric{(Tone 1)} O Lord, save Thy people and bless Thine inheritance, granting to Thy people victory over all adversaries, and by the power of Thy Cross, preserving Thine estate.

\subsubsection{Kontakion}

\rubric{(Tone 4)} O Christ our God, Who wast voluntarily lifted up on the Cross, grant Thy mercies to Thy new people named after Thee. Gladden with Thy power Orthodox Christians and give them victory over their enemies. May they have as an ally that invincible trophy, Thy weapon of peace.

\subsection{Thursday}

\subsubsection{Apolytikia}

\rubric{(Tone 3)} O Holy Apostles, intercede with the merciful God that He grant unto our souls forgiveness of offenses.

\rubric{(Tone 4)} The truth of things hath revealed thee to thy flock as a rule of faith, an icon of meekness, and a teacher of temperance; for this cause thou hast achieved the heights by humility, riches by poverty. O Father and Hierarch Nicholas, intercede with Christ God that our souls be saved.

\subsubsection{Kontakion}

Thou hast taken the firm and divinely inspired Preachers, O Lord, the top Apostles, for the enjoyment of Thy blessings and for repose. For Thou hast accepted their labors and death as above every burnt offering, O Thou Who alone knowest the secrets of our hearts.

\subsection{Friday}

\subsubsection{Apolytikion}

\rubric{(Tone 1)} O Lord, save Thy people and bless Thine inheritance, granting to Thy people victory over all adversaries, and by the power of Thy Cross, preserving Thine estate.

\subsection{Saturday}

\subsubsection{Apolytikia}

\rubric{(Tone 2)} O Apostles, martyrs, prophets, hierarchs, righteous, and just ones, who have finished your course well and have kept the Faith: seeing ye have boldness with the Savior, beseech Him for us, since He is good, that our souls be saved, we pray.

\rubric{(Tone 8)} Keep Thy servants in remembrance, O Lord, since Thou art good, and do Thou forgive their every sin in this life; for no man is without sin, except for Thee Who art able to grant rest even unto those that have departed hence.

\subsubsection{Kontakia}

With the Saints, give rest, O Christ, to the souls of Thy servants, where there is no pain, no sorrow, no sighing, but life everlasting.

The world offers to Thee, O Lord, as the Father of creation, the God-bearing Martyrs as the first-fruits of nature. By their prayers through the Mother of God keep Thy Church in deep peace, O Most Merciful One.
